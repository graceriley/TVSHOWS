  <p> Supernatural follows brothers Sam and Dean Winchester, who face a handful
    of monsters and mythical creatures. After, their mother dies, they are raised
    by their dad. Violent memories and relationship-threatening secrets add
    additional burdens on Sam and Dean as they investigate all things that go
    bump in the night. As old tricks and tools are rendered useless and friends
    betray them, the brothers must rely on each other as they encounter new
    enemies.</p>
